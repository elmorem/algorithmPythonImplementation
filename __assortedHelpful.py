#namedtuples are useful for when you want to pass in an immuitable object
#basically, what i'm is useful here is that you can use a tuple that is 
# imutalbe any place that you were previouisly going to pass in a tuple 
# but you don't want them to be able to alter the values.  A good use case 
# for this is when you create a class and it has some parameters that you don't want changed.
